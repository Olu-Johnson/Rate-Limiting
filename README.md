<p>Rate limiting is an essential security and performance feature in web applications. It controls the number of requests a client can make to a server within a specific time frame. This helps prevent abuse, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, and ensures fair usage of resources by all users. By limiting the number of requests, the server can maintain stability, improve performance, and safeguard against malicious activities.
</p>

<h2>How Rate Limiting Works</h2>
<p>
Rate limiting controls the number of requests a client, usually identified by an IP address, can make within a specific time frame. When a client surpasses this limit, the server will stop further requests from that client until the time window resets.
</p>

<h2>Key Concepts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Time Window: The duration for which the rate limit applies, such as per minute, per hour, or per day.
  </li>
   <li>
    Request Limit: The maximum number of requests allowed within the specified time window.
  </li>
   <li>
    Client Identification: Typically based on the clientâ€™s IP address, though it can also be tied to API keys or user accounts.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Implementing Rate Limiting in Node.js</h2>
<p>
In Node.js, rate limiting can be easily implemented using the express-rate-limit middleware. This middleware allows developers to set up rate limits for routes or the entire application.
</p>

<h2>Benefits of Rate Limiting</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Protection Against DDoS Attacks: Rate limiting helps mitigate the impact of DDoS attacks by restricting the number of requests, which prevents overwhelming the server with traffic.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved Server Stability: Ensuring the stability and responsiveness of the server involves preventing clients from overloading it with excessive requests.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fair Usage Enforcement: Rate limiting ensures that all users have fair access to resources, preventing a single user from monopolizing server capacity.
  </li>
</ul>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  Implementing rate limiting in Node.js is an effective way to improve the security, performance, and reliability of your web application. By setting appropriate limits on requests, you can protect your server from malicious attacks, maintain stability, and provide a better experience for all users.

<h2>How to run the code</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    clone the repository
  </li>
  <li>
    run "npm install" - this will intall all the dependencies (express, express-rate-limit)
  </li>
  <li>
    run "node server" to start the server
  </li>
<ul>
